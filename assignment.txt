Assignment 5: Quicksort Algorithm: Implementation, Analysis, and Randomization

    Overview:
        This assignment focuses on the Quicksort algorithm, its implementation, performance analysis, and a
        randomized version. You will explore the theoretical underpinnings of Quicksort, implement both
        deterministic and randomized versions, and analyze their performance under different conditions.
        The skills and knowledge gained from this assignment are directly applicable to a range of modern software
        technologies. Whether you're optimizing algorithms for large-scale data processing frameworks like Apache
        Hadoop or Spark, enhancing the performance of search algorithms in web services, or developing resource-
        efficient applications for mobile and embedded systems, the principles of Quicksort and its analysis will be
        invaluable.
        By the end of this assignment, you will have a deep understanding of the Quicksort algorithm, its
        implementation nuances, and its practical applications in today's technology-driven world. This knowledge
        will equip you to make informed decisions about algorithm selection and optimization in your future projects,
        contributing to the development of efficient and scalable software solutions.
        Quicksort Implementation and Analysis
            1. Implementation
                - Implement the Quicksort algorithm using Python. Your implementation should be clear, efficient, and
                correctly follow the steps for selecting a pivot, partitioning the array, and recursively sorting the subarrays.
            2. Performance Analysis
                - Provide a detailed analysis of the time complexity of Quicksort in the best, average, and worst cases.
                - Explain why the average-case time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) and the worst-case time complexity is
                \(O(n^2)\).
                - Discuss the space complexity and any additional overheads associated with the algorithm.
            3. Randomized Quicksort
                - Implement a randomized version of Quicksort where the pivot is chosen randomly from the subarray being
                sorted.
                - Analyze how randomization affects the performance of Quicksort and reduces the likelihood of encountering
                the worst-case scenario.
            4. Empirical Analysis
                - Empirically compare the running time of the deterministic and randomized versions of Quicksort on
                different input sizes and distributions (e.g., random, sorted, reverse-sorted).
                - Discuss the observed results and relate them to your theoretical analysis.
                Deliverables:
                - Well-documented source code for both the deterministic and randomized versions of Quicksort.
                - A detailed report discussing your implementation, performance analysis, and the impact of randomization
                on Quicksort.
                - Clear explanations of the time complexity analysis for both versions of Quicksort.
